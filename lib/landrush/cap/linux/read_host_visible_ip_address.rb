        # This is a fragile heuristic: we are simply assuming the IP address of
        # the last interface non-localhost IP address is the host-visible one.
        #
        # For VMWare, the interface that Vagrant uses is host accessible, so we
        # expect this to be the same as `read_ip_address`.
        #
        # For VirtualBox, the Vagrant interface is not host visible, so we add
        # our own private_network, which we expect this to return for us.
        #
        # If the Vagrantfile sets up any sort of fancy networking, this has the
        # potential to fail, which will break things.
        #
        # TODO: Find a better heuristic for this implementation.
