== How to avoid providing sudo password on OS X

When using Landrush on OS X, Landrush will try to create a file in
`/etc/resolver` to make the guest VM visible via DNS on the host. See *OS X* in the *Visibility on the Host* section of the link:Usage.adoc[Usage guide]. To create this file, sudo permissions are needed and Landrush
will ask you for your sudo password. +
 +
This can be avoided by adding the
following entries to the bottom of the sudoer configuration. Make sure
to edit your `/etc/sudoers` configuration via `sudo visudo`:

....
# Begin Landrush config
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_MKDIR = /bin/mkdir /etc/resolver/*
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_CP = /bin/cp /*/vagrant_landrush_host_config* /etc/resolver/*
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_CHMOD = /bin/chmod 644 /etc/resolver/*
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_MKDIR, VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_CP, VAGRANT_LANDRUSH_HOST_CHMOD
# End Landrush config
....

== Guest is unable to access the Internet

In some network configurations the access to outside DNS servers is
restricted (firewalls, VPN, etc). Since unmatched DNS queries are per
default passed through to Google's DNS servers, this can lead to the
fact that the guest cannot access anything in the outside world. +
 +
If you face problem with the guest's DNS, verify that you can access
Google's DNS server under __8.8.8.8__. If it does not work, you will
need to set a custom upstream DNS server. Check your network
configuration on the host or ask your network administrator about the
right DNS server address to use. You can set the custom DNS server via
the `config.landrush.upstream` option, see section on *Unmatched Queries* in the link:Usage.adoc[Usage guide].
