== Dynamic entries

Every time a VM is started, its IP address is automatically detected and
a DNS record is created that maps the hostname to its IP. The detection
works by listing all configured interfaces of the guest using
https://rubygems.org/gems/landrush-ip/versions/0.2.5[landrush-ip],
picking the last valid IP found, while ignoring any excluded interfaces.

Excluded interfaces are an array of regular expressions; the value shown
here is the default used when no explicit value for
`config.landrush.host_interface_excludes` is specified in your
`Vagrantfile`:

....
config.landrush.host_interface_excludes = [/lo[0-9]*/, /docker[0-9]+/, /tun[0-9]+/]
....

If Landrush fails to detect the correct IP address (or none at all), you
can extend this exclusion range to exclude more interfaces.

You can also make sure to only select a specific class of IP address
(`:ipv4`, `:ipv6` or `:any`). Either way, empty values will not be
returned, but in the case of `:any` you may get the IPv6 address for an
interface that has no IPv4 address. The default is to return the first
non-empty IPv4 address:

....
config.landrush.host_interface_class = :ipv4
....

If you need or want to select an interface explicitly and you know its
name, you can also tell Landrush to grab that interface's IP address
explicitly:

....
config.landrush.host_interface = 'eth0'
....

NOTE: If you specify an interface explicitly, it will have
priority over `config.landrush.host_interface_excludes`. In other words,
if `config.landrush.host_interface_excludes` is set to `[/eth[0-9]*/]`,
but `config.landrush.host_interface` is set to `eth0` and `eth0` exists
as an interface, the IP address of `eth0` is returned. The interface
setting takes precedence over the exclude setting. If the interface does
not exist, the regular heuristics will apply and Landrush will pick the
last non-excluded IP found.

If all else fails, you can override it entirely:

....
config.landrush.host_ip_address = '1.2.3.4'
....

This setting will override both the exclude and interface settings
completely.

If you are using a multi-machine `Vagrantfile`, configure this inside
each of your `config.vm.define` sections.

== Static entries

You can add static host entries to the DNS server in your `Vagrantfile`
like so:

....
config.landrush.host 'myhost.example.com', '1.2.3.4'
....

This is great for overriding production services for nodes you might be
testing locally. For example, perhaps you might want to override the
hostname of your puppetmaster to point to a local vagrant box instead.

== Wildcard Subdomains

For your convenience, any subdomain of a DNS entry known to Landrush
will resolve to the same IP address as the entry. For example, given
`myhost.vagrant.test -> 1.2.3.4`, both `foo.myhost.vagrant.test` and
`bar.myhost.vagrant.test` will also resolve to `1.2.3.4`.

If you would like to configure your guests to be accessible from the
host as subdomains of something other than the default `vagrant.test`,
you can use the `config.landrush.tld` option in your Vagrantfile like
so:

....
config.landrush.tld = 'vm'
....

NOTE: From the **host**, you will only be able to access subdomains
of your configured TLD by default, so wildcard subdomains only apply to
that space. For the **guest**, wildcard subdomains work for anything.

== Unmatched Queries

Any DNS queries that do not match any of Landrush's configuration data,
will be passed through to an upstream DNS server. Per default Landrush
uses Google's DNS server with the IP __8.8.8.8__.

If you would like to configure your own upstream servers, add upstream
entries to your `Vagrantfile` like so:

....
config.landrush.upstream '10.1.1.10'
# Set the port to 1001
config.landrush.upstream '10.1.2.10', 1001
# If your upstream is TCP only for some strange reason
config.landrush.upstream '10.1.3.10', 1001, :tcp
....

== Visibility on the Guest

Linux guests should automatically have their DNS traffic redirected via
`iptables` rules to the Landrush DNS server. File an issue if this does
not work for you.

To disable this functionality:

....
config.landrush.guest_redirect_dns = false
....

You may want to do this if you are already proxying all your DNS
requests through your host (for example, using VirtualBox's natdnshostresolver1
option) and you have DNS servers that you can easily set as upstreams in
the daemon (for example, DNS requests that go through the host's VPN
connection).

== Visibility on the Host

Visibility on the host means that the hostname of the VMs can be
resolved on the host's DNS system. Landrush will attempt an automatic
configuration of the host, but depending on the OS, manual configuration
might be required as well.

To disable this functionality:

....
config.landrush.host_redirect_dns = false
....

* OS X
+
If you are on an OS X host, we use a nice trick to unobtrusively add a
secondary DNS server only for specific domains. During startup Landrush automatically adds
a file into `/etc/resolver` that points
lookups for hostnames ending in your `config.landrush.tld` domain to its
DNS server. (See `man 5 resolver` on your Mac OS X host for more
information on this file's syntax.)

* Linux
+
Landrush tries to achieve the same behavior on Linux hosts using
`dnsmasq`. For some Linux distributions this happens automatically (you
might have to provide your _sudo_ password). If Landrush does not know
how to install and start `dnsmasq` on your favorite Linux distribution,
you can adjust the following example from Ubuntu:
+
....
sudo apt-get install -y resolvconf dnsmasq
sudo sh -c 'echo "server=/vagrant.test/127.0.0.1#10053" > /etc/dnsmasq.d/vagrant-landrush'
sudo service dnsmasq restart
....
+
If you use a TLD other than the default `vagrant.test`, replace the TLD
in the above instructions accordingly. Please be aware that anything
ending in `.local` as TLD will not work because the `avahi` daemon
reserves this TLD for its own uses.

* Windows
+
On Windows a secondary DNS server can be configured via the properties
of the network adapter used by the VM. Landrush will attempt to
configure the adapter automatically during startup. If this fails,
please follow the manual setup instructions below.
+
It is recommended to use an elevated command prompt (command prompt with
full administrator permissions), since admin privileges are needed to
make the required changes. Landrush will try to elevate your prompt
automatically, but this requires spawning of additional processes which in
turn loose some potentially important log messages.
+
In the following section manual network configuration is described using
Windows 10 and VirtualBox.
+
When running VirtualBox on Windows in combination with Landrush the
Network Connections
(`Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections`) looks
somewhat like this after a successful `vagrant up`: +
 +
+
image:img/network-connections.png[Network
Connections,title="Network Connections"] +
 +
There will be at least one VirtualBox network adapter. There might be
multiple depending on your configuration (number of networks configured)
and how many VMs you have running, but you just need to modify one.
+
In a first step, you need to identify the VirtualBox network adapter used
for the private network of your VM. Landrush requires a private network
adapter to work and will create one in case you are not explicitly
configuring one in your `Vagrantfile`.
+
To quickly view the settings of each network adapter you can run the
following command in a shell:
+
....
netsh interface ip show config
....
+
The output should look something like this:
+
....
Configuration for interface "Ethernet0"
    DHCP enabled:                         Yes
    IP Address:                           172.16.74.143
    Subnet Prefix:                        172.16.74.0/24 (mask 255.255.255.0)
    Default Gateway:                      172.16.74.2
    Gateway Metric:                       0
    InterfaceMetric:                      10
    DNS servers configured through DHCP:  172.16.74.2
    Register with which suffix:           Primary only
    WINS servers configured through DHCP: 172.16.74.2

Configuration for interface "VirtualBox Host-Only Network"
    DHCP enabled:                         No
    IP Address:                           10.1.2.1
    Subnet Prefix:                        10.1.2.0/24 (mask 255.255.255.0)
    InterfaceMetric:                      10
    Statically Configured DNS Servers:    None
    Register with which suffix:           Primary only
    Statically Configured WINS Servers:   None
....
+
In our case we are interested in the `VirtualBox Host-Only Network`
which has in this example the private network IP 10.1.2.1. If you do not
have a static private network IP configured and you cannot determine the
right adapter via the `netsh` output, ssh into the VM (`vagrant ssh`)
and run `ifconfig` to view the network configuration of the VM.
+
Once you identified the right network adapter run the following as
Administrator (using the network adapter name of the adapter with the
determined private network IP):
+
....
 netsh interface ipv4 add dnsserver "VirtualBox Host-Only Network" address=127.0.0.1 index=1
....
+
This should be enough for Windows 10. On other Windows versions, you
might have to also add your TLD to the DNS suffix list on the DNS
Advanced TCP/IP Settings tab: +

 +
* Other Devices (phone)
+
You might want to resolve Landrush's DNS-entries on _additional_
computing devices, like a mobile phone.
